Remind me I'm golden 
The fortress above the sun 
Why don't you spend nowhere with me? 
Follow the river and the path of the ones trying the names
Of the shore
Forever I can't find 
Struggling in a world of this fine 
Or this life 
I don't want it to be 
I'm not in to live
Fly into the distance 
Disappear for a while 
I don't know the sense of this 
But it is too late feeling alive
Destruction for the power 
Let me take control (Eliminance)
